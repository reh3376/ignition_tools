#### **Configuration Management**
```python
@dataclass
class VersionControlConfig:
    repository_path: Path
    git_enabled: bool = True
    auto_track_changes: bool = True
    conflict_prediction_enabled: bool = True
    impact_analysis_enabled: bool = True
    release_planning_enabled: bool = True
    risk_threshold: float = 0.7
