```python
async def run_comprehensive_tests(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Run comprehensive deployment tests following crawl_mcp.py methodology."""
    test_results = {
        "environment_validation": await self._test_environment_validation(),
        "docker_functionality": await self._test_docker_functionality(),
        "health_checks": await self._test_health_checks(),
