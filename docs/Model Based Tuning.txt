Model-Based Tuning: IMC and Lambda Methods1.      Why Choose IMC or Lambda Tuning Instead of Trial-and-Error?   1.1.     Trial-and-error tuning often results in:1.1.1. Excessively aggressive or overly conservative control.1.1.2. Poor disturbance rejection.1.1.3. Integral windup issues.1.2. Unstable performance if process conditions change.2. IMC (Internal Model Control) and Lambda tuning - are structured, model-based approaches that clearly relate controller settings (Kc, Ti, Td) to measurable process dynamics: dead time (?), time constant (?), and process gain (Kp).2.1. These methods deliver controllers that:2.1.1. Robustly handle disturbances.2.1.2. Gracefully manage systems with dead time.2.1.3. Provide predictable, stable, closed-loop control.2.2. When to use IMC:2.2.1. Process dead time (?) and time constant (?) are clearly know or measurable. 2.2.2. Process stability and Robustness matter more than extreme responsiveness.2.2.3. Reliable disturbance rejection and minimal overshoot are desired. 3. Process Model (FOPDT): IMC and Lambda tuning typically utilize a First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model to approximate the process: Gp?(s) = Kp? e^-?s? / ?s+1   3.1. Where:3.1.1. Gp?(s) = Process transfer f(x). It describes how input signals are converted to output signals in the Laplace domain.3.1.2. s = time in seconds.3.1.3. Kp = Process gain (?PV / ?CO).3.1.4. ? (Tau) = Process time constant (speed of PV response).3.1.5. ? (Theta) = Dead time (delay between action and process response).3.2. Key Process Parameters:3.2.1. Process Gain (Kp): Defined as the change in the process variable (PV) divided by the change in controller output (CO): Kp?= ?PV / ?CO.3.2.2. Time Constant (?): Represents how quickly the PV responds to a change. 3.2.2.1. A smaller ? indicates a faster response, while a larger ? means slower response.3.2.3. Dead Time (?): The delay before any noticeable change in PV after a change in CO is introduced. Also referred to as "transport delay" or "process lag."3.2.4. Desired Closed-Loop Time Constant (?): A chosen parameter that dictates the desired response speed and stability of the closed-loop system:3.2.4.1. Smaller ?: Faster, more aggressive control.3.2.4.2. Larger ?: Slower, more stable and robust control.      3.3. Rule of Thumb for Thermal Processes: Set ? between two to three times the dead time: ? = 2? to 3?.4. IMC Tuning Formulas for PI Controllers: IMC tuning aims to counteract process dynamics by using a simplified internal model plus a low-pass filter for enhanced stability.      4.1. Proportional Gain (Kc): Kc?= ?  / (Kp??(?+?)) ?      4.2. Integral Time (?i): set to the process time constant Ð ?i = ?5. Practical Steps for Controller Tuning:    5.1. Conduct a Step Test      5.1.1. Set controller to manual mode.      5.1.2. Apply a small, known step change in controller output (CO).5.1.3. Record how the process variable (PV) responds over time.5.2. Determine Process Parameters from Step Test5.2.1. Kp: Change in PV divided by change in CO.5.2.2. ?: Time for PV to reach ~63% of its total response.5.2.3. ?: Delay before PV begins responding.5.3. Select Desired Closed-Loop Time Constant (?)5.3.1. Choose ? based on desired balance of response speed and stability.5.3.2. For thermal processes, a common starting point is ? = 2? to 3?.5.4. Compute Controller Settings5.4.1. Input Kp, ?, ?, and ? into the IMC tuning formulas to calculate Kc and ?i.5.5. Implement and Test Controller Settings5.5.1. Enter computed Kc and ?i values into the PI controller.5.5.2. Monitor system performance.5.5.3. Adjust ? if necessary for desired performance.6.
