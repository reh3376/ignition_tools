# Roadmap Rewrite Archive - 2025-06-18

## Overview
This archive contains files from the comprehensive roadmap restructuring and cleanup performed on 2025-06-18.

## Problem Statement
The original `docs/roadmap.md` file had become disjointed and unprofessional, with several issues:
- **Truncated Phase 9**: The Phase 9 section was incomplete and ended abruptly
- **Disjointed structure**: Inconsistent formatting and organization
- **Redundant sections**: Overlapping and repeated content
- **Missing current status updates**: Status didn't reflect actual project progress

## Solution Implemented
A complete restructuring and rewrite of the roadmap document to create a professional, well-organized, and comprehensive project roadmap.
