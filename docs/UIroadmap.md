# Frontend UI Development Roadmap (Phase 12)

*Phase 12 focuses on building the new React-based frontend UI, migrating/mirroring functionality from the existing CLI and Streamlit interface into a cohesive, user-friendly web application. This roadmap is structured into phases and sections. Each task is considered complete only when its development is finished **and** the corresponding tests (unit, integration, and/or end-to-end) are implemented and passing.* **Developers/agents should continuously update this roadmap** as features are completed or new CLI capabilities are identified, to ensure full coverage of CLI functionality in the UI.

## Phase 12.1: App Shell & Framework Setup

### Section 12.1.1: Project Initialization & Configuration
- [ ] **Initialize React Project:** Set up a new React 18 + TypeScript project using Vite. Configure base project structure (as per `frontend.mdc` standards) and version control.
- [ ] **Install Core Dependencies:** Add React Router, React Query, Tailwind CSS (including PostCSS and autoprefixer), and other required libraries. Verify that the development server runs and shows a basic "Hello World" page.
- [ ] **Tailwind & Theme Setup:** Configure `tailwind.config.js` with the project’s color palette, typography, and breakpoints (matching any existing style guidelines from Streamlit or branding). Enable dark mode if needed and verify Tailwind is correctly building styles.
- [ ] **Global State Management:** Set up any global context providers (e.g., for user auth state, theme toggling) and include them in the React app tree. Ensure that these are well-typed and tested with simple defaults.

### Section 12.1.2: Core Layout and Navigation (App Shell)
- [ ] **Implement App Shell Layout:** Create the main layout component that defines the high-level UI structure – e.g., a responsive header or navbar, a sidebar for navigation (if applicable), and a content area. Include placeholders for now (logo, dummy links) to be filled in later.
- [ ] **Routing Structure:** Implement React Router with route placeholders for major sections of the app.
- [ ] **Responsive Navigation:** Make sure the header/sidebar is responsive (e.g., collapsible sidebar or a mobile menu for smaller screens).
- [ ] **Error Boundary Integration:** Implement a global Error Boundary component and wrap the main app routes with it.
