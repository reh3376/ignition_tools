- **Time Estimation**: Predicts refactoring duration based on complexity metrics

### 4. CLI Integration & User Interface
**File**: `src/ignition/code_intelligence/cli_commands.py`

#### Available Commands:
```bash
# Detect large files needing refactoring
ign refactor detect --directory src --threshold 1000 --format table

# Analyze specific file for refactoring opportunities
ign refactor analyze path/to/file.py --format detailed

# Split a large file into smaller modules
ign refactor split path/to/large_file.py --dry-run

# Batch split multiple files
ign refactor batch-split --directory src --max-files 5 --dry-run

# Execute comprehensive refactoring workflow
ign refactor workflow --directory src --dry-run

# Rollback a completed workflow
ign refactor rollback workflow_id_12345
```

#### Output Formats:
- **Table Format**: Clean tabular display for quick scanning
- **JSON Format**: Machine-readable output for automation
- **Detailed Format**: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations
