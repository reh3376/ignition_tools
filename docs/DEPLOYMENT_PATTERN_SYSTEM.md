# Deployment Pattern Learning System

## Overview

The Deployment Pattern Learning System is an intelligent AI-powered component of the IGN Scripts platform that learns from deployment history to provide intelligent recommendations, environment adaptations, and rollback scenarios. This system continuously improves deployment success rates through machine learning and pattern recognition.

## Core Components

### üß† DeploymentPatternLearner Class
**Location**: `src/ignition/graph/deployment_pattern_learner.py`

The main intelligence engine that provides:
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Confidence scoring based on historical success rates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic detection of successful deployment configurations
- **Continuous Learning**: System improves with every deployment execution
- **Environment Adaptation**: Intelligent configuration adjustments for different environments

### üóÑÔ∏è Neo4j Graph Database Integration

The system extends the Neo4j graph schema with specialized deployment nodes:

#### Node Types
- **DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN**: Captures successful deployment configurations
- **DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION**: Records individual deployment instances
- **ENVIRONMENT_ADAPTATION**: Environment-specific configuration adaptations
- **ROLLBACK_SCENARIO**: Rollback procedures and recovery patterns
- **DEPLOYMENT_METRIC**: Performance and success metrics tracking

#### Relationship Types
- **FOLLOWS_DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN**: Links executions to patterns
- **ADAPTS_TO_ENVIRONMENT**: Environment adaptation relationships
- **TRIGGERS_ROLLBACK**: Rollback trigger relationships
- **MEASURES_DEPLOYMENT**: Metric measurement relationships
- **LEARNS_FROM_EXECUTION**: Learning relationships
- **SIMILAR_TO_PATTERN**: Pattern similarity relationships
- **CAUSED_BY_ISSUE**: Issue causation relationships
- **RESOLVED_BY_ADAPTATION**: Adaptation resolution relationships

## Key Features

### 1. Deployment Execution Recording
```python
execution_id = learner.record_deployment_execution(
    execution_name="Production HMI Update",
    deployment_type="update",
    target_environment="production",
    gateway_host="prod-gateway-01.company.com",
    deployment_strategy="blue_green",
    resources_deployed=["project", "tag_provider", "database"],
    configuration_used={
        "backup_enabled": True,
        "validation_timeout": 300,
        "rollback_threshold": 0.95
    },
    status="completed",
    started_at=datetime.now(),
    completed_at=datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=15)
)
```

### 2. AI-Powered Recommendations
```python
recommendations = learner.get_deployment_recommendations(
    target_environment="production",
    resource_types=["project", "database"],
    deployment_strategy="blue_green",
    limit=5
)
```

Returns recommendations with:
- **Confidence Scores**: Based on historical success rates
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments
- **Configuration Templates**: Proven configuration patterns
- **Applicability Reasons**: Why this pattern is recommended

### 3. Environment Adaptations
```python
adaptations = learner.get_environment_adaptations(
    source_environment="staging",
    target_environment="production",
    limit=3
)
```

Provides intelligent adaptations for:
- Configuration differences between environments
- Resource mapping requirements
- Security adjustments
- Performance tuning parameters

### 4. Rollback Scenarios
```python
scenarios = learner.get_rollback_scenarios(
    environment="production",
    resource_types=["database", "project"],
    limit=3
)
```

Learns from rollback experiences to provide:
- Trigger conditions for rollbacks
- Successful rollback procedures
- Recovery time estimates
- Success rate predictions

### 5. Deployment Analytics
```python
analytics = learner.get_deployment_analytics(
    environment="production",
    days_back=30,
    metric_types=["duration", "success_rate"]
)
```

Provides comprehensive analytics:
- Success/failure rates
- Average deployment durations
- Rollback frequency
- Performance trends
- Actionable insights

## CLI Integration

The system provides four powerful CLI commands:

### 1. Deployment Recommendations
```bash
ign deploy recommendations -e production -r project,database -s blue_green
```

### 2. Environment Adaptations
```bash
ign deploy adaptations -s staging -t production
```

### 3. Rollback Scenarios
```bash
ign deploy rollback-scenarios -e production -r database,project
```

### 4. Deployment Analytics
```bash
ign deploy analytics -e production -d 30 -m duration,success_rate
```

## Pattern Learning Process

### 1. Execution Recording
Every deployment execution is recorded with:
- Configuration details
- Resource types deployed
- Environment information
- Success/failure status
- Performance metrics
- Lessons learned

### 2. Pattern Extraction
The system automatically identifies patterns from successful deployments:
- Common configuration combinations
- Environment-specific adaptations
- Resource deployment sequences
- Timing patterns

### 3. Confidence Scoring
Patterns are scored based on:
- **Success Count**: Number of successful uses
- **Failure Count**: Number of failures
- **Success Rate**: Overall success percentage
- **Recency**: How recently the pattern was used
- **Applicability**: Relevance to current scenario

### 4. Continuous Improvement
The system continuously improves by:
- Updating pattern confidence scores
- Learning from new deployment outcomes
- Identifying emerging patterns
- Adapting to environment changes
